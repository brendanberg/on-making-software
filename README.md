# On Making Software

This document is a guide to growing collaborative software projects.
Successful software is more than just the source code that makes it run.
It is the culmination of effort by the authors of code and documentation,
by community evangelists and supporters, by contributors of bug fixes and
test suites. The most successful software is a cooperative endeavor.

This is at first, a collection of thoughts collected from various leaders and
developers that seem to have constructive and insightful thoughts on the
process of software development, from planning to adoption engineering.

While there occassionally may be code snippets to illustrate a particular
point, this document is not intended to be a coding standards document for
any specific language.

This repository is public, but the content is carefully selected and edited.
As an experiment, I encourage discussion and suggestions in the Wiki and
Issues sections on GitHub.
